                    interface makes the process of buying a snack quicker and more convenient by eliminating interaction

                    choose from multiple payment options, input the code of the desired item, and collect it from the slot it
                    falls into.

                    <p>
                        I observed several users of an on campus vending machine, during the day and later at night, to find general patterns of behaviour,
                        outliers, and pain points. I made the following <span style="background-color: gainsboro;">key observations</span>:
                    </p>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>All users used the card reader for payment (credit/debit cards or student ID cards).</li>
                        <li>All users swiped their card through the card reader multiple times, either flipping the card around or 
                            changing the direction in which they swiped.</li>
                        <li>Most users looked at the screen after swiping their cards.</li>
                        <li>More users approached the vending machine at night than in the day.</li>
                        <li>Most users purchased one item. One user purchased multiple items, repeating the swipe-select-collect process multiple 
                            times - they apologized repeatedly to the person next to them for the time it took.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
        
                <div class="user-interviews">
                    <h3><span style="background-color: rgb(206, 230, 251); font-weight: 500;">User Interviews</span></h3>

                    <p>I conducted three interviews with students who had used campus vending machines previously. My main <span style="background-color: gainsboro;">questions</span> were:</p>
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>What motivates you to use a campus vending machine?</li>
                        <li>Is there a typical pattern to the times that you use vending machines?</li>
                        <li>Which method of payment do you like best?</li>
                        <li>Have you experienced any challenges in the process of using campus vending machines?</li>
                        <li>What would be your ideal way of conducting a full transaction at a vending machine?</li>
                    </ol>
    
                    <p>Through these interviews, I was able to gain deeper insight into their user experience and their pain points. Important <span style="background-color: gainsboro;">findings</span> include:</p>
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>There are distinct motivations to use campus vending machines: first, to stock up when the user has a lot
                            of points to spend on their student card; second, as a last resort when no other store is accessible.</li>        
                        <li>Users tend to use vending machines more often at night, during weekdays, and during colder months
                            of the year.</li>
                        <li>Users prefer card payments (debit, credit, or student card) since they do not typically carry cash or coins; however, 
                            it is unclear which way to swipe the card and whether it's worked.</li>
                        <li>Other challenges: using a credit card loads a default $4 into the
                            machine even if a user only wants one item; there's no indication of how much time a user has to make
                            selections before the machine shuts down the transaction; and it is annoying that the collection door is so low down.</li>
                        <li>Some users would like to swipe a card at the machine and have it just take the 
                            cost of the desired item, so there is no waste of money; some would like to enter a total amount of money, add 
                            items until meeting that total, and be able to buy them all at once instead of one by one, saving
                            time.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>I learned a lot from this project, but two things surprised me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are <span style="background-color: gainsboro">correct and incorrect ways to interview</span>; small differences in the way interview questions are framed can result in quite different interview 'findings'.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to identify <span style="background-color: gainsboro">different personas from just one user</span> interview - this also shows the importance of interviews instead of just observation.

                    I could move forward by attempting to <span style="background-color: rgb(206, 230, 251); font-weight: 500;">design a vending machine interface</span>
                    that addresses these issues! The challenge lies in addressing multiple personas'
