                <p>
                    To design an interactive interface for an emerging startup's concept, using an 
                    iterative design process flow - sketching ideas, creating an interactive 
                    hi-fi prototype that incorporates critiques, conducting user testing, 
                    and contacting the startup.

                    We chose <span style="font-weight:bold;">WANTD</span>, an online sneaker marketplace specifically for sneaker resale. It aims to 
                    facilitate fast, efficient resale for resellers and buyers. Its concept includes:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual storefronts</li>
                    <li>Bulk inventory management for resellers, using bulk listing tools</li>
                    <li>Live video auctions</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We also saw it as a hub for lovers of sneaker culture. The concept interested us - we wanted to see how we 
                    could make it feel like a <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">sneaker</span> site as opposed to any e-commerce fashion site.

                <p>
                    Imagine that you're a sneakerhead, and you're looking to purchase a popular 
                    shoe that you've always wanted on a new online reselling platform.

                <p>We would really appreciate it if
                    throughout the process of completing the task, you would think out loud about what your thought process

                <h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
                <p>
                    As expected, users <span style="font-weight:bold;">fared well overall</span> during user testing, with all three completing the main task and subtasks (login, browse for shoe, add to cart) with minimal errors. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The average ratings for the ease of the subtasks were 4.7/5 (logging in), 4.3/5 (browsing), and 5/5 (adding to cart), demonstrating the site's straightforward usability.
                        Given the intuitive layout and icons we chose, we did not expect major issues - users commented that site was simple to navigate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users commented that the platform was well suited to a younger audience, with aesthetics matched the theme of sneaker culture. This was also
                        something we aimed for, so the feedback was not surprising.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p>Users completed the tasks with <span style="font-weight:bold;">minimal errors.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users encountered minor complications during subtask 2 - browsing. Users 1 and 3 first attempted to find the shoe
                        with the menu search icon, and said they wished they could search directly in the searchbar. User 2 tried to filter by brand 
                        to find the shoe, and voiced minor confusion as the prototype lacked interaction
                        for that feature. (All users still successfully completed the task).
                    </li>
                    <li>User 3 was slightly confused about where to login, and thought the small person icon was not the most effective.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <br>
                <p>These are <span style="font-weight:bold;">potential improvements</span> we could make given the results.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The errors encountered are largely to do with the interaction level of the prototype, rather than something missing in the interface.
                        While users said they understood that the prototype lacked full functionality, their behaviour showed the instinct for users to use a search 
                        bar when tasked with browsing.
                        Future versions of the prototype should make it interactive to address this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To address the login confusion, an option is to include the word 'Login' underneath the icon when a user is not logged in, and the user's name or 'Account' when they are logged in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can lean into the 'sneaker culture' aesthetic further, since that was received well.
